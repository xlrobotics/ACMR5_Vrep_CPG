# ACMR5_Vrep_CPG
A CPG controller to generate serpentine locomotion on ACMR5 robot in Vrep.
Use Genetic Algorithm to optimize the parameters of the CPG network, some functions and libraries are referred from the work in https://github.com/sayantanauddy/hierarchical_bipedal_controller. 

## Requirements
- deap 1.2.2 
- vrep pro-edu_3.4.0
- python 3.5.5

## Run
run ga.py to carry out genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. See deap documentation to modify the configurations of the algorithm.
